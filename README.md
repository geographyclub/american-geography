# American Geography
This is how I'm working with census and street data.

1. [Importing](#1-importing)
2. [Processing](#2-processing)
2. [Exporting](#3-exporting)

## 1. Importing

Census geography files
```
# national level
ogr2ogr -overwrite -skipfailures --config PG_USE_COPY YES -f PGDump -t_srs "EPSG:3857" /vsistdout/ tlgdb_2021_a_us_nationgeo.gdb | psql -d us -f -

# substate level
ogr2ogr -overwrite -skipfailures --config PG_USE_COPY YES -f PGDump -t_srs "EPSG:3857" /vsistdout/ tlgdb_2021_a_us_substategeo.gdb | psql -d us -f -

# union census designated places and incorporated places
psql -d us -c "CREATE TABLE place AS (SELECT * FROM incorporated_place UNION ALL SELECT * FROM census_designated_place);"

# merge state files then import puma
ogrmerge.py -overwrite_ds -single -nln puma -o puma.gpkg $(ls *.zip | sed 's/^/\/vsizip\//g' | paste -sd' ')
ogr2ogr -overwrite -skipfailures -nlt promote_to_multi --config PG_USE_COPY YES -f PGDump -t_srs "EPSG:3857" /vsistdout/ puma.gpkg | psql -d us -f -
```

Census population tables
```
iconv -f latin1 -t ascii//TRANSLIT NST-EST2021-alldata.csv > NST-EST2021-alldata_iconv.csv
psql -d us -c "CREATE TABLE nst_est2021($(head -1 NST-EST2021-alldata_iconv.csv | sed -e 's/,/ VARCHAR,/g' -e 's/\r$/ VARCHAR/g'));"
psql -d us -c "\COPY nst_est2021 FROM 'NST-EST2021-alldata_iconv.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;"
```

Census data tables
```
# todo: 2019-2010
table='dp05_state_2020'
file='ACSDP5Y2020.DP05_data_with_overlays_2022-07-26T084339.csv'
iconv -f latin1 -t ascii//TRANSLIT ${file} | awk 'NR!=2' > ${file%.*}_iconv.csv
psql -d us -c "CREATE TABLE ${table}($(head -1 ${file} | sed -e 's/"//g' -e 's/,/ VARCHAR,/g' -e 's/\r$/ VARCHAR/g'));"
psql -d us -c "\COPY ${table} FROM ${file%.*}_iconv.csv WITH CSV HEADER;"
```

OpenStreetMap
```
ogr2ogr -overwrite -skipfailures --config OSM_MAX_TMPFILE_SIZE 1000 --config OGR_INTERLEAVED_READING YES --config PG_USE_COPY YES -f PGDump -t_srs "EPSG:3857" -nln points_us /vsistdout/ us-latest.osm.pbf points | psql -d us -f -
```

GeoNames
```
ogr2ogr -overwrite -skipfailures --config PG_USE_COPY YES -lco precision=NO -f PGDump -t_srs 'EPSG:3857' -nln geonames_us -where "countrycode = 'US'" /vsistdout/ PG:dbname=world geonames | psql -d us -f -
```

## 2. Processing
I chose several interesting sounding columns from ACS datatables, mostly percentages.
```
