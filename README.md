# american-geography
This is how I processed US census data for Leaflet.

### Importing into psql
Geography files:
```
# national level
ogr2ogr -overwrite -skipfailures --config PG_USE_COPY YES -f PGDump -t_srs "EPSG:3857" /vsistdout/ tlgdb_2021_a_us_nationgeo.gdb | psql -d us -f -

# substate level
ogr2ogr -overwrite -skipfailures --config PG_USE_COPY YES -f PGDump -t_srs "EPSG:3857" /vsistdout/ tlgdb_2021_a_us_substategeo.gdb | psql -d us -f -

# union census designated places and incorporated places
psql -d us -c "CREATE TABLE place AS (SELECT * FROM incorporated_place UNION ALL SELECT * FROM census_designated_place);"

# merge then import puma
ogrmerge.py -overwrite_ds -single -nln puma2020 -o puma2020.gpkg $(ls *.zip | sed 's/^/\/vsizip\//g' | paste -sd' ')
ogr2ogr -overwrite -skipfailures -nlt promote_to_multi --config PG_USE_COPY YES -f PGDump -t_srs "EPSG:3857" /vsistdout/ puma2020.gpkg | psql -d us -f -

# geonames
ogr2ogr -overwrite -skipfailures --config PG_USE_COPY YES -lco precision=NO -f PGDump -t_srs 'EPSG:3857' -nln geonames_us -where "countrycode = 'US'" /vsistdout/ PG:dbname=world geonames | psql -d us -f -

# osm
ogr2ogr -overwrite -skipfailures --config PG_USE_COPY YES -f PGDump -t_srs "EPSG:3857" -nln points_us /vsistdout/ us-latest.osm.pbf points | psql -d us -f -
```

Population tables:
```
iconv -f latin1 -t ascii//TRANSLIT NST-EST2021-alldata.csv > NST-EST2021-alldata_iconv.csv
psql -d us -c "CREATE TABLE nst_est2021($(head -1 NST-EST2021-alldata_iconv.csv | sed -e 's/,/ VARCHAR,/g' -e 's/\r$/ VARCHAR/g'));"
psql -d us -c "\COPY nst_est2021 FROM 'NST-EST2021-alldata_iconv.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;"
```

Data tables:
```
# todo: 2019-2010
table='dp05_state_2020'
file='ACSDP5Y2020.DP05_data_with_overlays_2022-07-26T084339.csv'
iconv -f latin1 -t ascii//TRANSLIT ${file} | awk 'NR!=2' > ${file%.*}_iconv.csv
psql -d us -c "CREATE TABLE ${table}($(head -1 ${file} | sed -e 's/"//g' -e 's/,/ VARCHAR,/g' -e 's/\r$/ VARCHAR/g'));"
psql -d us -c "\COPY ${table} FROM ${file%.*}_iconv.csv WITH CSV HEADER;"
```

### Joining geography to datasets
I chose several interesting sounding columns from ACS datatables, mostly percentages.

US:
```

### Adding zscores
I added zscores to these columns.

States:
```
psql -qAtX -d us -c '\d state2020;' | grep -v "geoid" | grep -v "SHAPE" | grep -v "sumlev" | grep -v "region" | grep -v "division" | grep -v "state" | grep -v "name" | sed -e 's/|.*//g' | while read column; do
  psql -d us -c "ALTER TABLE state2020 ADD COLUMN zscore_${column} REAL;"
  psql -d us -c "WITH b AS (SELECT geoid, (CAST(${column} AS REAL) - AVG(CAST(${column} AS REAL)) OVER()) / STDDEV(CAST(${column} AS REAL)) OVER() AS zscore FROM state2020 WHERE CAST(${column} AS TEXT) ~ '^[0-9\\\.]+$') UPDATE state2020 a SET zscore_${column} = b.zscore FROM b WHERE a.geoid = b.geoid;"
done
```

Counties (pop2020 > 100000):
```
psql -qAtX -d us -c '\d county2020;' | grep -v "geoid" | grep -v "SHAPE" | grep -v "sumlev" | grep -v "region" | grep -v "division" | grep -v "state" | grep -v "county" | grep -v "stname" | grep -v "ctyname" | grep -v "state_county" | sed -e 's/|.*//g' | while read column; do
  psql -d us -c "ALTER TABLE county2020 ADD COLUMN zscore_${column} REAL;"
  psql -d us -c "WITH b AS (SELECT geoid, (CAST(${column} AS REAL) - AVG(CAST(${column} AS REAL)) OVER()) / STDDEV(CAST(${column} AS REAL)) OVER() AS zscore FROM county2020 WHERE CAST(${column} AS TEXT) ~ '^[0-9\\\.]+$' AND CAST(pop2020 AS REAL) > 100000) UPDATE county2020 a SET zscore_${column} = b.zscore FROM b WHERE a.geoid = b.geoid;"
done
```

Places (pop2020 > 100000):
```
psql -qAtX -d us -c '\d place2020;' | grep -v "objectid" | grep -v "SHAPE" | grep -v "placens" | grep -v "geoid" | grep -v "namelsad" | grep -v "classfp" | grep -v "funcstat" | grep -v "aland" | grep -v "awater" | grep -v "intptlat" | grep -v "intptlon" | sed -e 's/|.*//g' | while read column; do
  psql -d us -c "ALTER TABLE place2020 ADD COLUMN zscore_${column} REAL;"
  psql -d us -c "WITH b AS (SELECT geoid, (CAST(${column} AS REAL) - AVG(CAST(${column} AS REAL)) OVER()) / STDDEV(CAST(${column} AS REAL)) OVER() AS zscore FROM place2020 WHERE CAST(${column} AS TEXT) ~ '^[0-9\\\.]+$' AND CAST(pop2020 AS REAL) > 100000) UPDATE place2020 a SET zscore_${column} = b.zscore FROM b WHERE a.geoid = b.geoid;"
done
```

PUMAs:
```
psql -qAtX -d us -c '\d puma2020' | grep -v "fid" | grep -v "geom" | grep -v "statefp10" | grep -v "pumace10" | grep -v "geoid10" | grep -v "namelsad10" | grep -v "mtfcc10" | grep -v "funcstat10" | grep -v "aland10" | grep -v "awater10" | grep -v "intptlat10" | grep -v "intptlon10" | sed -e 's/|.*//g' | while read column; do

done
```

### Exporting to geojson
States:
```
# significant zscores
zcolumns_all=$(psql -Aqt -d us -c '\d state2020' | grep "zscore_" | sed -e 's/|.*//g' | paste -sd,)
